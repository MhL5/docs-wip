# On Developer Experience

Developer Experience (DX) is about building products developers [_love_](/n/devtools) to use. I‚Äôve officially been doing DX work since 2020, but it‚Äôs been something I‚Äôve cared about my whole career.

> **Note:** I gave this as a meetup talk in 2025. You can view the [recording here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfJMy0RxvaE).

## 1. Documentation

Docs make or break [developer products](/n/devtools).

They must be high-quality and available everywhere: on your website, in their editor, and inside [AI chatbots](https://v0.dev/). Your goal is write content beginners can understand and experts appreciate.

Great docs are a product themselves. They need constant updates and polish. New product features can‚Äôt ship without the reference docs.

**_Suggestions_**

1. Ensure docs have many code examples you can copy/paste or [run](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/v0).
2. Optimize for skimming (good use of **bold**, _italic_, lists, headings, images, etc).
3. With writing, be both precise and concise ‚Äì avoid technical jargon and idioms.
4. Keep the first-time experience simple and slowly reveal complexity.
5. You should still document workarounds even if it‚Äôs a product gap.
6. [Use AI](https://github.com/aidar-freeed/ai-codereviewer/blob/a9a064dfa1db8c83f40ef63f6e247fa09c935ed6/src/main.ts) to automate reviews on docs for spelling, grammar, and brevity.
7. Make it easy for developers to leave feedback on docs (e.g. typos).
8. Embed docs directly in the code for in-editor feedback (e.g. [JSDoc](https://v0.dev/chat/jsd-oc-explanation-bz59neoxb8v)).
9. Add automated checks for broken links on git pushes ([example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/.github/actions/validate-docs-links)).

## 2. Community

Building community is a long-term investment. It must be in your company DNA.

It‚Äôs _not_ a collection of developers you are trying to sell your product to. It‚Äôs an [exchange](/n/moderation). They share bugs, _you fix them_. They submit pull requests, _you merge and encourage them_.

This is how you understand what‚Äôs working (or not working) with your product. Their feedback shapes the product direction and roadmap.

A community forms around a product when developers feel heard. They share their wins and frustrations, and you respond by improving the product or clarifying the docs. You must meet developers where they already are: GitHub, X, Reddit, Slack, or at meetups.

**_Suggestions_**

- You can‚Äôt spend too much time talking to developers in the community.
- Make yourself accessible to answer questions (e.g. host an [AMA](https://x.com/leerob/status/1890405718227837261)).
- Monitor feedback on social media to understand community sentiment.
- Use a Slackbot to send realtime user feedback to product teams.
- Invest in high-quality swag for your top community members.
- Everybody loves stickers ‚Äî and they‚Äôre pretty cheap ‚Äî create a bunch!

## 3. Education

Education is the best form of [marketing](/n/developer-marketing), second only to customer testimonials.

Good education not only shows people _how_ to use your product but _why_ it exists and _what_ they can accomplish with it. It‚Äôs part storytelling, part technical guide, part product demo.

**_Suggestions_**

- Build [demos](https://x.com/leerob/status/1874891166585651626) that show [real-world](https://x.com/leerob/status/1708280997488333078) usage of your product (not just hello world).
- If you answer the same question multiple times, turn it into a guide.
- You need both reference material (docs) and structured learning ([courses](https://nextjs.org/learn)).

# A demo of `react-markdown`

`react-markdown` is a markdown component for React.

üëâ Changes are re-rendered as you type.

üëà Try writing some markdown on the left.

## Overview

- Follows [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org)
- Optionally follows [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
- Renders actual React elements instead of using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Lets you define your own components (to render `MyHeading` instead of `'h1'`)
- Has a lot of plugins

## Contents

Here is an example of a plugin in action
([`remark-toc`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc)).
**This section is replaced by an actual table of contents**.

## Syntax highlighting

Here is an example of a plugin to highlight code:
[`rehype-starry-night`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-starry-night).

````js
import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dom";
import { MarkdownHooks } from "react-markdown";
import rehypeStarryNight from "rehype-starry-night";

const test = `i am so lonely`;

const markdown = `

# Your markdown here

`;

ReactDom.render(

{" "}
<MarkdownHooks rehypePlugins={[rehypeStarryNight]}>{markdown}</MarkdownHooks>, document.querySelector("#content")
); ```

Pretty neat, eh?

## GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)

For GFM, you can _also_ use a plugin:
[`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown#use).
It adds support for GitHub-specific extensions to the language:
tables, strikethrough, tasklists, and literal URLs.

These features **do not work by default**.
üëÜ Use the toggle above to add the plugin.

|    Feature | Support              |
| ---------: | :------------------- |
| CommonMark | 100%                 |
|        GFM | 100% w/ `remark-gfm` |

~~strikethrough~~

- [ ] task list
- [x] checked item

https://example.com

## HTML in markdown

‚ö†Ô∏è HTML in markdown is quite unsafe, but if you want to support it, you can
use [`rehype-raw`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw).
You should probably combine it with
[`rehype-sanitize`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-sanitize).

<blockquote>üëÜ Use the toggle above to add the plugin.</blockquote>

## Components

You can pass components to change things:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dom";
import Markdown from "react-markdown";
import MyFancyRule from "./components/my-fancy-rule.js";

const markdown = `
# Your markdown here
`;

import { getPosts } from "@/lib/posts";
import { Post } from "@/ui/post";

export default async function Page() {
  const posts = await getPosts();

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <Post key={post.id} post={post} />
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
````
